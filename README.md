# Fire Detection using YOLO and Ultralytics

This project is a fire detection system that uses YOLO (You Only Look Once) and the Ultralytics library for real-time fire detection in images and videos. It leverages PyTorch and Ultralytics to achieve high accuracy and performance.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) (with CUDA support for GPU acceleration)
- [Ultralytics YOLO](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5)

### Install Dependencies

To get started, you need to install the necessary libraries.

```bash
pip install torch
pip install ultralytics
