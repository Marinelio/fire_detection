# üî• Fire Detection - Real-Time Fire Detection System

**Fire Detection** is a real-time system designed to detect fires using computer vision techniques. This project uses machine learning models to identify fire in images and videos, making it suitable for applications in surveillance systems, drones, and other safety-related technologies.

## üìã Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to get the Fire Detection system running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed before running the project:

- **Python 3.x** (preferably Python 3.6 or later)
- **Pip** (Python's package installer)

### Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Marinelio/fire_detection.git
cd fire_detection
Install Dependencies
Install the necessary Python libraries using pip. You can use a virtual environment for a cleaner setup:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Fire Detection
To run the fire detection system on an image or video, use the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
python detect_fire.py <input_file> <output_file>
<input_file>: The path to the image or video file you want to process.

<output_file>: The path where the processed output will be saved.

Example usage:

bash
Copy
Edit
python detect_fire.py input_video.mp4 output_video.mp4
Model Training (Optional)
If you want to train your own fire detection model, use the following steps:

Prepare your dataset with labeled images containing fire and non-fire instances.

Train the model using the script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python train_model.py
This will start the model training process. You can adjust hyperparameters and configurations in the config.py file.

Testing
To test the model on a set of images or video, run the test_model.py script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python test_model.py --test_images ./test_data/
This will run the trained model on the specified test images.

### Notes:
1. **Requirements**: Make sure that the `requirements.txt` file exists in your repository and lists the dependencies like `opencv-python`, `tensorflow` or `torch`, etc.
2. **Model Details**: If you have specific instructions for training, testing, or fine-tuning the model, you can expand the **Model Training** section.
3. **Scripts**: Modify the script names (`detect_fire.py`, `train_model.py`, etc.) based on your actual script names in the repository. 

This should give a basic structure for your project! Let me know if you need further customization.
